# WebVoter

WebVoter is a free (as in speech) voting system designed to allow
secure voting via the web. The system also allows easy storage of
manual votes. The system has been proven in 2004, 2005 and 2006 in
[Helsinki University of Technology Student Union](http://www.tky.fi),
[The Student Union of Helsinki School of Economics](http://www.kyweb.fi),
and [ The Hanken Student Union](http://www.shsweb.fi) elections (both
[Single Transferrable Vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Transferrable_Vote)
and [d'Hondt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D) result calculation methods).

The system allows for multiple elections being run simultaneously.
All elections can have configurable graphical elements.
